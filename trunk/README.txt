  Description
  ===============

  PetBattleAutoForfeit prompts for immediate forfeit when you enter a
  wild pet battle where none of the enemy pets are an upgrade for you.

  Left-click anywhere on the screen to forfeit. Right-click to continue
  the battle anyway.

  Usage
  =========

  Type “/pbaf” to open the options pane, or browse to it in the game’s
  Interface Options window.

  You can specify the minimum quality to consider an upgrade (eg. if you
  are only interested in rares) and how many levels higher a wild pet
  must be to be considered an upgrade at the same quality.

  Language Support
  ====================

  BetterBattlePetTooltip is compatible with all game localizations.

  The options are translated into English, Spanish, and French.

  If you have translations for another language, post a comment on
  the WoWInterface download page.
